# Iterative Dichotomizer 3 (ID3) algorithm

Algorithm designed to create the shallowest decision tree that is consistent with data given.
The ID3 algorithm builds the tree by:
- recursive
- depth-first
- choose best descriptive feature to test (the question that provides the most information aka reduces heterogeneity) 
- compute the /b information gain of the descriptive features in the training dataset
